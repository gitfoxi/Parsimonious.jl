Cache works the same as LPEG?

Really untangle the escaping issue so you can give good instructions on how to
make a literal doublequote and a literal backslash.

Make sure I get the same number of cache hits as Python

Parallel?

Make fulltext a member of all NodeVisitor (and maybe Expression?) so you don't have to keep passing it to visit()

Finish tuple conversion of Node and calls from Expression

LPEG-like declaritive interface

Benchmark against: Parsley, LPEG, PEG.js

Clean style like `base/pkg`


Stupid Ideas
------------

OnOf optimization -- when you match, if it's not the first option then swap it with the next earlier option in the order
This way, a more frequently matched option will be checked first.
Of course, this is stupid because in PEG it does matter what order things match in. Derp


Suggestions for Benchmark.jl
----------------------------

* mean is more interesting than average
* need to make sure compiler can't optimize you our by providing random data and using the result (print to /dev/null)


Suggestions for Profiling
-------------------------

* Sort by height (depth?) from bottom (top?) of stack


Suggestions for Julia
---------------------

Arbitrary quotes like Perl
