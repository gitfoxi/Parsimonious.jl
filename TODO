Name modules with capital first letter like Nodes.jl. Git doesn't want to lt me do this.

What to do with the cache between parsing texts? Is it good to keep? Mess things up? Grow without bound?

Really untangle the escaping issue so you can give good instructions on how to
make a literal doublequote and a literal backslash.

Make sure I get the same number of cache hits as Python

Parallel?

Suggestions for Benchmark.jl
* mean is more interesting than average
* need to make sure compiler can't optimize you our by providing random data and using the result (print to /dev/null)

Should I be carrying around empty children lists or have a node type without a children (or without match)




Stupid Ideas
------------

OnOf optimization -- when you match, if it's not the first option then swap it with the next earlier option in the order
This way, a more frequently matched option will be checked first.
Of course, this is stupid because in PEG it does matter what order things match in. Derp
